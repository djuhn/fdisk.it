For over 5 years, a spreadsheet listing Critical Care patients has been used daily in several units in the North West.  Iâ€™ve released (open sourced, MIT license) blank versions of the files on Github: Alt-F11 in Excel will show the (hacky) VBA code for customisation.

Features:

- Automated incremental backup for governance purposes
- Email copies (for backup, printing or other departments to use)
- Intuitive move & discharge functions to rapidly update based on patient flow - no more copying and pasting loads of cells!
