title: Best fit text
---
On the North West School of Anaesthesia FRCA courses, we teach for professional examinations using example questions.  These are projected on a large screen from a laptop running a Meteor application.  Candidates are connected to a wireless network and use their phones/laptops/tablets to select their answers to the question.

A longstanding issue I’d wanted to fit was the size of the text.  Because the content that gets projected to the screen is a variable quantity of text, I needed a reliable method of scaling a HTML to fit the screen.

Using a combination of a jQuery plugin, some CSS and a bit of hacking around, I’ve found a solution I’m happy with.
